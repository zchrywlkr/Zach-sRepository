Using HashMaps

Pair up to write code that does the following (this can all be in a main method):
Create a HashMap that will be used to keep track of how many points each player on a team scores in a particular game.  Keys should be of type String and values of type Integer.
Add the following stats to the map:
Smith - 23 points
Jones - 12 points
Jordan - 45 points
Pippen - 32 points
Kerr - 15 points
Print each players name and associated point total
Calculate the average points per game for the team and print it to the screen
